    "After living in San Diego for the better part of 3 years I have been to over a handful of small parks around the area that I live in and only one large park (Balboa Park). When I went to Balboa park, I remember distinctly how there were lots of people walking around or engaging in some activity. It was busier than most parks I have been too and I associated that with the idea that this park must be very liked. Conversely, whenever I would go to the smaller parks around my area, I would notice that they tended to by empty in both activities one could do, and number or people. This got me thinking if smaller parks were less liked than their bigger counterparts.\n",

The primary information I would be looking for would be the name of parks, size of the park, some sort of rating scale I could use as an indication of how people felt about the park. Ideally, I would want to have this information on the parks throughout the years to see if a trend is present regarding the relationship between size of parks and people's ratings of them. Ideally, I think it would be best to store the observations in a datframe where the columns would be for the variables I am interested in exploring and the rows would be each park in San Diego as an observation.\n",
